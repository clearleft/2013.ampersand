	 		<h1>The Future of CSS Typography</h1>
	 		<p class="talk">This talk will focus on efforts to improve typographic support in CSS. Beyond just defining the @font-face rule, new properties in the CSS3 Fonts module provide explicit control over kerning, ligatures, small-caps and a variety of features commonly available in OpenType fonts.</p>
	 		<p class="talk">These features will allow designers to solve a number of basic typographic problems in a much more elegant way than previously was possible. </p>
	 		<p class="talk">How these new properties evolved and some of the design problems involved will be discussed in detail. The problem of consistent rendering across browsers and the effect of that on both font and web design will also be discussed.</p>
