			<h1>Workshop Title 2</h1>
			<p>Responsive design is one of the most exciting developments to hit the web for some time. But there’s a common misconception that it involves merely slapping some media queries on to an existing desktop-centric site and labelling the result "mobile-friendly." Nothing could be further from the truth. This workshop will demonstrate that truly effective responsive design must begin with the content first, which is then progressively adapted to a multitude of screen sizes and environments.</p>
			<p>This workshop will help you to construct web sites that will feel natural on a whole range of devices, from mobile phones to tablets, laptops, e-readers and devices we haven’t even thought of yet.</p>
			<p>You’ll learn how to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Prioritise content</li>
				<li>Ensure that no visitor is denied access to information,</li>
				<li>Decide when to switch layouts using media queries,</li>
				<li>Apply fluid layouts based on percentages,</li>
				<li>Serve up different sized images for different environments,</li>
				<li>Figure out new processes and workflows that embrace the ever-changing nature of the web.</li>
