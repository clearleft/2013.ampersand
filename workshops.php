		<h1>Workshops</h1>
		<p class="subheading">This year we are running workshops in <a href="#wrk1">grid systems</a>, <a href="#wrk2">responsive design</a> and <a href="#wrk3">letterpress</a>. All workshop attendees receive complimentary entrance to the Ampersand conference.</p>
		<div id="wrk1" class="workshop-item">
			<h1>Designing Grid Systems with Mark&nbsp;Boulton</h1>
			<p>The way we make websites has changed. Responsive design has challenged the way we think about layout and their underpinning foundation: grid systems. In this workshop, Mark will take it right back to basics on how to design your grids, what things you need to consider for designing grids for different applications and devices, and how we can practically start working &#8216;content out&#8217;.</p>
<p>Warning: this full day workshop requires work. In fact, most of the day will be spent working on grids with peer review and critique thrown in for good measure. At the end of the day, you&#8217;ll know why 12 columns is not always the best grid to use, you&#8217;ll know the difference between compound grids and modular grids and when to apply them, and – most importantly – you&#8217;ll have the workflows to start making your own grids from scratch.</p>

			<h1>Responsive Design with Jeremy&nbsp;Keith</h1>
			<p>Responsive design is one of the most exciting developments to hit the web for some time. But there’s a common misconception that it involves merely slapping some media queries on to an existing desktop-centric site and labelling the result &#8220;mobile-friendly.&#8221; Nothing could be further from the truth. This workshop will demonstrate that truly effective responsive design must begin with the content first, which is then progressively adapted to a multitude of screen sizes and environments.</p>
			<p>This full day workshop will help you to construct web sites that will feel natural on a whole range of devices, from mobile phones to tablets, laptops, e-readers and devices we haven’t even thought of yet.</p>
