The shapes of the giant concrete sea defences struck me as very typographic forms. This type was originally developed to work as 3D objects. The different textures found along the path were contrasted by the vast expanse of sea, and helped liven this 2D rendering.</p>

It was developed in Madrid, Spain, in 2013, and has regular and italic variants, and small caps. It includes the basic diacritics and special glyphs, such as 〈ð, æ, œ, þ, ß, ø〉 which allow it to be used in several languages. Compared to Fuencarral Regular, its italic variant has a certain calligraphic spirit with radically-form-changing glyphs 〈a, g, ß, &amp;〉, and some ligatures. Fuencarral Regular and Italic are the beginning of a project aiming to develop a typographic family with different visual weights. </p>

The two are connected by their proportions, text-fit and shared tastes between both designers. Their optical size, range of weights and darkness are intended to match. The project was about finding a balance between harmonising two separate designs into a useful combination while maintaining their unique characteristics.

				<p class="drop-cap-first-para">This typeface is based on my friend Jae Kyoung’s handwriting: I used to always be fascinated by her handwriting and wanted to mimic it. Since she is originally from Korea, her writing of roman letters seems to have the same style as her writing of Korean characters, in the sense that they all have the same neat height. I found that the texture created by Korean characters could construct an interesting result if it were to be exaggerated and applied to the roman letters. As a result JK combines both uppercase and lowercase to create a single textured alphabet. </p>
